"BENCH_PRESS" = "
Mechanics: Compound
Force: Push

How to do it?

- Lie supine (on your back) on a flat bench.
- Spread your legs, bring your feet back, and place them firmly on the ground. Either your toes or your heels should be planted on the floor.
- Arch your back.
- Dismount the barbell using a grip that is a little over shoulder-width apart.
- While holding the barbell, retract (push together) your shoulder blades and straighten your wrists.
- Inhale as you lower the barbell to your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in at a 45-degree angle.
- Exhale as you press the barbell back up to the starting position.
- Repeat.

Tips

- Planting your feet, arching your back, tucking in your elbows, and straightening your wrists allow you to drive from your legs, through your body, and up through your arms—thus getting your entire body behind the press. Use this form to produce a strong foundation from which to press, increase your leverage, and give yourself a mechanical advantage.
- Tucking in your elbows also reduces the pressure on your shoulders.
- Never use a false grip. A false grip (aka thumbless or suicide grip) is when you don’t wrap your thumbs around the bar.
- If lifting heavy weights, have a spotter ready.
- Like the barbell squat and barbell deadlift, the barbell bench press is a major mass&strength-building exercise.

"MACHINE_FLY"="
Mechanics: Isolation
Force: Push

How to do it?

- Sit on the fly machine with your back pressed firmly against the back support.
- Grasp the levers at shoulder height.
- Internally rotate your shoulders so that your wrists, elbows, and shoulders are level.
- Keeping your elbows slightly bent, exhale as you push the levers together.
- Inhale as you reverse the motion until you feel a mild stretch in your chest or shoulders.

Tips

- Adjust the fly machine for comfort and proper back support.
- Keep the movement slow and deliberate.
- By internally rotating your shoulders (so that your wrists, elbows, and shoulders are level), you better isolate your pectoralis major because the origin and insertion of the muscle are brought more into line.
- The machine fly is not a major mass-building exercise. As an isolation exercise, it is useful if you want to warm up your chest, pre-exhaust it before the compound chest exercises, or flush it at the end of a chest workout.
";
"LAT_PULLDOWN" = "
Mechanics: Compound
Force: Pull

How to do it?

- Choose your weight and sit on the lat pull-down machine, adjusting it so that your thighs fit under the supports.
- Grasp the bar with a pronated (overhand) grip, with your hands more than shoulder-width apart.
- Exhale as you slowly pull the bar down until it touches the upper part of your chest.
- Squeeze your shoulder blades together and hold for a count of two.
- Inhale as you slowly return the bar to the starting position.
- Repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.

Tips

- Pull the bar down with your elbows, not your biceps.
- Keep your torso still.
- Extend your arms fully on the return phase.
- Do not pull the bar down behind your neck, as doing so will force you to bend your neck out of alignment with your spine as well as put your shoulder joint through an extreme range of motion—both of which increase the risk of injury.
- The wide-grip lat pull-down is great for your teres major and upper lats. It widens them and gives you a v-taper. If you use a reverse (underhand) grip, you will emphasize your lower lats, giving you lats that run farther down your sides. Therefore, incorporate both variations.
- Also known as the wide-grip cable pulldown.
";
"CHEST_PRESS" = "
Mechanics: compound
Force: Push

How to do it?

- Adjust the seat so that the handles are approximately chest height.
- Sit in the chest press machine with your back pressed firmly against the back rest.
- Grasp the handles with a pronated (overhand) grip.
- Plant your feet firmly on the ground.
- Exhale as you press the handles out until your arms are fully extended.
- Inhale as you reverse the motion until you feel a mild stretch in your chest.
- Repeat.

Tips

- To minimize the pressure on your shoulder joints, keep your elbows a little lower than your shoulders.
- Some chest press machines have a foot lever that will help you to push the handles forward from their resting positions, making them easier to grasp at the start of the exercise. Otherwise, you’d have to stretch your arms far back to grasp the handles. After you grasp the handles, you have to release the lever before starting to press. Once the set is over, you have to use the same foot lever to brace the handles and lower them back to their resting positions without having to stretch your arms far back.
- The machine chest press is great if you want to push very heavy weights with your chest but don’t have anyone to help you with the barbell bench press. Otherwise, the barbell bench press is favorable to the machine chest press. The reason is that the barbell bench press necessitates the recruitment of more stabilizer muscles. The machine chest press is also great for beginners, the elderly, and people undergoing rehabilitation.
";
"CABLE_ROW" = "
Mechanics: Compound
Force: Pull

How to do it?

- Sit facing the cable row machine and place your feet on the foot rests.
- Grasp the double-row bar and slide your bottom backward until your knees are almost straight. You torso should be leaning forward and your arms and shoulders should be stretching forward.
- Exhale as you slowly lean backward, straighten your back, and pull the v-bar to your abdomen, keeping your elbows close to your body. Pull your shoulders back and stick out your chest at the top of the movement.
- Hold for a count of two and squeeze your back muscles.
- Inhale as you slowly lean forward and return the double-row bar to the starting position, with your arms and shoulders stretching forward and your lower back bent forward.
- Repeat.

Tips

- Do not excessively arch your back.
- Pull with your elbows, not with your biceps.
- Avoid swinging your torso back and forth.
- Start light and add weight gradually to allow your lower back time to adapt.
- Many people think that your biceps acts as a synergist in rowing exercises such as the seated cable row. In fact, it only acts as a dynamic stabilizer, along with the long head of your triceps brachii.
- Most people will tell you to keep your back straight and your chest out throughout the seated cable row exercise. That’s known as the straight-back seated cable row. It’s a different exercise, which doesn’t dynamically work your erector spinae (spinal erectors). The exercise described above does dynamically work your spinal erectors.
";
"SQUATS" = "
Mechanics: Compound
Force: Push

How to do it?

- Load a barbell on a rack at upper-chest height.
- Step under the barbell so that it rests on the back of your shoulders, and grasp the bar at each side.
- Dismount the barbell and step backward carefully. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart and pointing slightly outwards.
- Inhale as you squat down by pushing your butt backward and bending your knees forward. Keep your torso upright, and descend at least until your knees are bent at a 90-degree angle.
- Exhale as you push your body back up to the starting position, driving from your heels and keeping your torso upright.
- Repeat.

Tips

- Keep your back straight, torso upright, head up, and feet flat.
- Keep your knees and feet pointing in the same direction.
- Practice proper barbell squat form with an unloaded barbell.
- Start light and add weight gradually, allowing your legs and lower back to adapt.
- If lifting heavy, have a spotter ready, or use a squat rack or power rack.
- The barbell squat is arguably the king of all exercises, the only challenger being the barbell deadlift. The exercise is loved by men because it is great at strengthening the legs and core, shocking the body into releasing testosterone, and promoting the development of body-wide muscle and strength. The exercise is loved by women because it is very effective at toning butts and thighs.
- Most barbell squat-related accidents happen while stepping back with the barbell.
";
"LUNGES" = "
Mechanics: Compound
Force: Push

How to do it?

- Stand with feet together, holding a dumbbell in each hand, with your arms by your sides.
- Inhale as you take a large step forward with one leg, landing on your heel first and then lowering your forefoot.
- At the same time, keeping your torso upright, lower your body until the knee of your supporting leg almost touches the floor.
- Exhale as you drive back up with your heel and step back into the starting position.
- Repeat with your opposite leg.
- Keep alternating the leg with which you lunge.

Tips

- Keep your torso upright, and your head, feet, and knees facing forward.
- Keep the dumbbells by your sides or a little behind you, which can help with balance.
- As you lower yourself into a kneeling position, do not allow your front knee to move in front of your toes.
- The larger your lunge, the more emphasis you will place on your gluteus maximus instead of your quadriceps.
- The dumbbell lunge is a very beneficial exercise that helps you to develop balance, coordination, and the unilateral (one-sided) functional strength of your lower body.
";
"BARBELL_BOX_SQUAT" = "
Mechanics: Compound
Force: Push

How to do it?

- Stand in front of a box or bench with a barbell on the front of your shoulders and your hands crossed over the barbell to keep it stable.
- Spread your feet so that they are positioned a little wider than shoulder width (i.e. wider than with a regular barbell front squat).
- Point your feet and knees out diagonally in the same direction.
- Keeping your torso upright, inhale as you slowly squat by first pushing your hips backward and then your knees outward.
- Stop and hold for one second when your butt touches the box. Do not sit on the box and rock backwards.
- Exhale as your spring back upward without rocking forward.
- Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Tips

- Control the movement all the way down to the box. Do not sit on the box and rock backwards, as this leads to compression of the spine; just pause.
- When you spring upward, drive through your heels, and do not rock forward.
- Keep your shins vertical and your knees out.
- Keep your feet and knees pointing in the same direction, and your feet flat on the floor.
- For safety, use a power cage, with the safety pins set at an appropriate height to prevent injuries.
- The purpose of using the box in the barbell front box squat is to eliminate the stretch reflex, which occurs at the bottom of the squat and aids in the concentric (ascending) phase of the repetition. Eliminating the stretch reflex makes the exercise more difficult and therefore allows you to use less weight to overload the front squat movement pattern.
- By eliminating the stretch reflex, the barbell front box squat allows experienced squatters to improve their front squat strength, which carries over to their barbell front squat.
- As less weight can be used with the barbell front box squat, the exercise is also suitable for people with knee problems.
- The barbell front box squat (or any type of box squat for that matter) is not suitable for beginners, who first have to learn how to squat.
- If you don’t have a box, use a bench.
- The height of the box or bench should allow you to descend until your thighs are at least parallel with the floor.
";
"LEG_EXTENSION" = "
Mechanics: Isolation
Force: Push

How to do it?

- Choose your weight and sit on the leg extension machine.
- Make the necessary adjustments so that the backs of your thighs are fully supported by the seat and your back is fully supported by the back rest.
- Hook your feet under the foot pads of the lever with the pads resting just above your ankles.
- Grasp the side handles for support.
- Exhale as you lift the lever forwards and upwards by straightening your legs until they are fully extended.
- Hold for a count of two.
- Inhale as you return the lever to the starting position by bending your knees.

Tips

- Adjust the back support and seat to accommodate full range of motion.
- Position your knees at the same axis as the lever fulcrum.
- As you raise the padded lever, do not allow your hips to curl up; keep your thighs in firm contact with the seat.
- Do not go too heavy because it can be bad for your knees.
- The leg extension exercise mainly develops your lower quads. To put more emphasis on your upper quads, as you raise your legs, point your toes forward.
- The exercise can also be performed with one leg at a time.
- The leg extension should not be your primary quad exercise. There are far better options. The barbell squat, for example, builds your quads equally well, as well as simultaneously builds and strengthens many other muscle groups, strengthens your core, and helps you to develop functional strength. Use the leg extension only to warm up your quads, pre-exhaust them before squats, or flush them at the end of a leg workout.
";
"LEG_CURL"="
Mechanics: Isolation
Force: Pull

How to do it?

- Lie prone (face down) on the leg curl bench and position your legs under the lever pads. Your knees should be just below the edge of the bench and the lever pads should be resting just above your heels.
- Hold the handles for stability.
- Exhale as you flex your knees and curl the lever until it touches the back of your thighs.
- Hold for a count of two.
- Inhale as you lower the lever to the starting position.

Tips

- Keep the movement slow and controlled.
- Try to resist the lowering of the lever; don’t just let it drop.
- Don’t allow your hips to rise off the bench.
- Adjust the lever for optimal leverage.
- Keep your ankles flexed so that your toes point toward your shins. This allows your gastrocnemii to offer better assistance.
- Adjusting the orientation of your feet during the lying leg curl emphasizes different hamstring muscles. Keep your feet straight to emphasize all hamstrings. Turn your feet inward to emphasize your inner hamstrings (semitendinosus and semimembranosus). Turn your feet outward to emphasize your outer hamstring (biceps femoris).

"ANTIOXIDANTS"="
Free radicals are constantly being formed during metabolism.
Without antioxidants, they would destroy our bodies very quickly.

However, it's important to keep in mind that free radicals also serve important functions that are essential for our survival.
For example, the body's immune cells use free radicals to kill bacteria that try to infect us.
As with so many things in the body, we need a certain balance... we need the right amount of free radicals, and the right amount of antioxidants to keep them in check.
When this balance gets disrupted, things can start to go wrong.
When the free radicals (pro-oxidants) outnumber the antioxidants, this can lead to a state called oxidative stress.
During oxidative stress, important molecules in the body can become severely damaged... sometimes even leading to cell death.
Several stress factors and lifestyle habits are known to promote excessive free radical formation and oxidative stress:

Air pollution.
Cigarette smoke.
Alcohol intake.
Toxins.
High blood sugar levels.
Consuming large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Radiation, including excessive sunbathing.
Infections by bacteria, fungi or viruses.
Excessive intake of iron, magnesium, copper, or zinc.
Too little oxygen in the body.
Too much oxygen in the body.
Intense and prolonged exercise, which causes tissue damage.
Excessive intake of antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E.
Antioxidant deficiency.
Prolonged oxidative stress leads to increased risk of negative health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. It is also thought to contribute to the aging process.

Plants and animals, and all other forms of life, have their own defenses against free radicals and the oxidative damage caused by them.
Therefore, antioxidants are found in pretty much all foods of plant and animal origin.
Getting antioxidants from foods is important. In fact, our life depends on the intake of certain antioxidants – namely, vitamin C and vitamin E.
The health benefits associated with a diet rich in plants is, at least partially, due to the wide diversity of antioxidants they provide.
Meat products and fish also contain antioxidants, but in smaller amounts compared to fruits and vegetables. Berries are a particularly good source.
Then there are plenty of other good sources of antioxidants... including green tea, coffee and dark chocolate.

Here is a list:
Onions,   Grapes,    Walnuts,    Soybeans,   Ginger ,   Blueberries ,   Sunflower seeds,    Broad beans,    Garlic,    Strawberries,
Chives,   Cherries,  Tomatoes,    Apples,    Carrots,    Grapefruit,     Kale,    Cranberries,    Spinach,    Blackberries,
Cauliflower,    Pomegranate,    Cabbage,    Orange,     Cabbage,    Plum,    Brussels sprouts,    Pineapple,    Peas,    Lemon,
Dates,   Kiwi,    Watermelon,    Apricots,   Prunes...

"PROTEIN"="
Proteins are organic molecules made up of amino acids – the building blocks of life.
Proteins are essential for growth, immune function, and the construction of hormones and enzymes. It is used to repair, maintain, and build the muscle fibers that are damaged during workouts, and can also act as an energy source in the absence of carbohydrate. So - without an adequate protein intake, our bodies can’t function well at all.
During digestion, our body breaks down the protein we eat into individual amino acids, which contribute to the plasma pool of amino acids. This pool is a storage reserve of amino acids that circulate in the blood.
Protein also helps replace worn out cells, transports various substances throughout the body, and aids in growth and repair.

To build muscle, you have to consume more protein than your body breaks down. An insufficient intake will result in slow strength and muscle gains or even no gains at all!
Consuming protein can also increase levels of the hormone named glucagon, and can help to control body fat. Glucagon is released when blood sugar levels go down.  This causes the liver to break down stored glycogen into glucose (read: energy) for the body.
It can also help to liberate free fatty acids from adipose tissue (belly fat, for example) - another way to get fuel for cells and make that bodyfat do something useful with itself.

How much protein does individual need?

Needs are based on activity level, although there are some other factors too.
The basic recommendation for protein intake is 0.8 grams per kilogram (or around 0.36 g per pound) of body mass in untrained, generally healthy adults. For instance, a 70 kg person would consume around 56 grams a day.
For people doing resistance training or some form of high intensity exercises, protein needs might go up to  1.4-2.0 g/kg (or around 0.64-0.9 g/lb) of body mass. So, a 70 kg person would then need about 100-140 g of protein per day.
The body needs its protein stores to be continually replenished, which means that you should consume moderate amounts of protein at regular intervals (more smaller meals a day).

When you exercise, the body synthesizes proteins for up to 48 hours after the exercise.  Interestingly, during and immediately after exercise, protein breakdown is increased as well. In fact, for a short period, the rate of breakdown becomes greater than the rate of building. This is called catabolic state.
However, taking in enough protein during the pre- and post-exercise period can offset this catabolic state.

Can I overeat protein?

Yes. If you overeat protein, this extra protein can be converted into sugar or fat in the body. However, protein isn’t as easily or quickly converted as carbohydrates or fat.

Sources of protein:     Eggs,   Chicken & turkey breast,     Tuna,      Salmon,    Beef,      Diary products,       Seafood (schrimps, fish),       Broccoli,       Almonds,        Peanuts...
";

"CARBS"="
Carbohydrate is your body’s main source of fuel. If you don’t eat enough carbohydrate, when you exercise, you’ll fatigue sooner, and your muscle and strength gains will be reduced. On the other hand, if you are overeating carbohydrate, it will be converted to body fat. Eating a surplus of carbohydrates can also make you feel tired and sluggish, ‘foggy’ and unfocused, and/or even depressed. Repeatedly eating too many carb-dense foods can put your body at risk of hypoglycemia, insulin resistance, and Type 2 Diabetes. In addition, you may experience weight gain, difficulty losing weight, or even obesity.

Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed by your body. It helps to keep your digestive system healthy.
Carbohydrate digestion breaks down more complex forms of carbohydrates (oligo- and polysaccharides) into simpler (monosaccharides glucose, fructose, and galactose) for eventual release into the bloodstream in the form of glucose, which is essential to life. The brain and central nervous system prefer glucose for fuel and benefit from a continuously available supply.
All carbohydrates we consume are digested into simple sugars before they’re absorbed by the body, regardless of whether the food source is a sugar cube or a high-fiber, low glycemic index bowl of oatmeal. It’s just that the “healthier carbs” are digested and absorbed much slower while the “non-healthy” carbs are digested very quickly.
Although the fundamental process of digestion is the same, if you eat simple sugars and refined carbohydrates (which the body breaks down rapidly), you may notice elevations in blood triglyceride levels, bad cholesterol, and insulin resistance.
On the other hand, carbohydrates that are digested and absorbed slowly, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, can help to control insulin response, energy levels, and body composition. Such unrefined, unprocessed, complex carbohydrate sources may reduce triglycerides and improve your cholesterol profile. Other benefits of a lower glycemic diet include increased vitamin and mineral intake, increased fiber intake, enhanced satiety,  and blood sugar control.

The average person’s minimum carbohydrate intake should be 130 grams per day, with a majority coming from vegetables and fruits. Higher amounts of carbohydrates are needed with increased physical activity levels.

Sources of carbs:
Oatmeal,        Yams,       Brown rice,     Potatoes,       100% whole wheat bread,     100% whole wheat pasta, Beans and lentils,        Quinoa,     Couscous,       Pumpkin,      Grapefruit,     Apples,     Blueberries,        Cantaloupe,     Oranges,        Bananas,        Peaches,        Grapes,     Strawberries,       Pineapple,       Plums,      Pears,      Berries,       Mango,      Broccoli,       Kale,       Asparagus,      Spinach,        Salad greens,       Tomatoes,       Peppers (green and red),        Onions,     Mushrooms,      Cucumbers,     Zucchini,        Carrots,        Green beans,        Peas,       Cauliflower...

"FATLOSS" = "
The best fat-burning workout is a mix of heavy training and cardio. Heavier weights are best for building muscle and improving strength, and also burning a lot of calories. If you can keep building muscle while dieting and doing your cardio, you are in for some serious fat-burning.
Females should not be afraid of weight training - it wont pack some huge muscles to your body, but will help you burn some serious number of calories.
If you are starter, and want to lose fat first, then you should start with some light cardio exercises. It can be mixture of threadmill jogging, bike, nordic skiing, rowing, rope jumping etc.
Incorporate full body workout with your cardio sessions, to increase number of calories burned.
